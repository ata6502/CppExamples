MEMORY MANAGEMENT
- Use local scope (stack semantics) as much as you can.
- If you need to use the free store, use smart pointers.

COLLECTIONS
- Measure performance to ensure you are using the right collection.
- Reserve storage in advance using the reserve method.

EXCEPTIONS
- Catch exceptions by reference. Otherwise, slicing may occur. This applies to the exceptions that are in the exception hierarchy.
- Catch more specific exceptions first. For example, catch std::out_of_range before catching std::exception.
